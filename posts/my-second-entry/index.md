Here's a **big** part of the trick. Imagine an element has a line-height of 1.4rem and you want to make sure it only shows a maximum of three lines of text. If you set the max-height to 1.4rem * 3, you've done it!

## Section Two

I'm not the worlds biggest fan of united line-height, but alas, it's necessary here to do the math. I'm also not the biggest fan of setting it over and over on elements, so let's set a variable we can use later, and then use it to set a global line-height.

```js
  const b = 10 // Want to try this out
```
